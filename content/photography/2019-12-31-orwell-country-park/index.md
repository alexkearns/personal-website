These images were taken on a walk around Orwell Country Park on New Years Eve. I'm fortunate enough to have places like these just 15 minutes from my doorstep, it's somewhere I'm definitely planning on returning to.

I treated this as a bit of a recon trip, as I had an image in mind for a different time of day and I wanted to see what the light would be like as well as any potentially interesting subjects. IMO, the trip was a success as I am now able to plan out my next visit to the park (at sunset) to capture it in a different light.
