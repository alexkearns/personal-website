description: An account of my first foray into public speaking.

I'd been to a few of the Tech and Toast breakfast events (organised by [TechEast](https://www.techeast.com)) in the months prior to giving this talk and really liked the format that they took. 

They're an hour long (ish) event running from 8am to 9am every Friday morning, rotating between four locations in the East of England (Norwich, Ipswich, Cambridge, Colchester). Each event has a 15 minute lightning talk about something that should be interesting to both technical and non-technical people.

I had expressed an interest in speaking at one of the future meetups to the organisers and as it turned out, they were looking for a host and speaker on the 22 November 2019. After speaking to ubisend about the logistics of hosting it in our office, we managed to get everything booked in and confirmed.

The topic that I decided to speak about was an overview of the Local Recall project that I'd worked on (with some technical bits thrown in). Given the size of the project, fitting it all in a 15 minute talk was quite daunting. To make sure that I was going into the right amount of detail about the right bits, I did a dry run with the ubisend team the day before. After a couple of last minute tweaks - it was good to go!

Safe to say, as it was my first proper public speaking event, I was a little nervous. A lot more people turned up than I was expecting which didn't help with that! After speaking to a few people afterwards, it seemed to have gone well which I was pleased with.
