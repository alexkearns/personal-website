description: A Valentine's Day talk for an audience in Colchester.

After speaking at a Tech and Toast event in Norwich towards the end of last year, I was delighted when [TechEast](https://www.techeast.com) asked me to speak again. This time, it was at the Colchester meetup at the Innovation Centre. The Innovation Centre was a fantastic facility based on the University of Essex site, designed to support businesses and entreprenuers through their early years.

Last time round I spoke about Local Recall, a project I'd worked on at ubisend, with a little bit of technical talk sprinkled in for good measure. This time, I wanted to go for a topic that was less linked to ubisend. I opted to talk about scaling websites / web applications, titling it *Handling Peaks in Website Traffic*.

This was a topic that has been majority self taught and that I have a real interest in moving into as a career. The one hesitation I had about giving speaking on this was that the audience were likely to be only about 1/3 technical. When the topic has potential to be so complex from a technical perspective, I wanted to make sure that I pitched the concepts at the right level.

I'm pleased to say that the talk went very well, drawing in the biggest crowd yet at a Tech and Toast event. Feedback after the event from people that attended was all positive, confirming the fact that I'd pitched it at the perfect level.

Here's just a few kind words from attendees on LinkedIn about the talk.
